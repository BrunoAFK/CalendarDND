# Firebase toggles for build-time collection flags.
# These generate BuildConfig values used in App.kt:
# - BuildConfig.CRASHLYTICS_ENABLED
# - BuildConfig.ANALYTICS_ENABLED
# AppConfig reads them to enable/disable Firebase collection at startup.
#
# To disable collection globally, uncomment and set to false:
# crashlyticsEnabled=false
# analyticsEnabled=false
#
# You can also override per-build:
# ./gradlew assembleDebug -PcrashlyticsEnabled=false -PanalyticsEnabled=false

# Debug tools toggle for in-app diagnostics (Settings -> Debug).
# BuildConfig.DEBUG_TOOLS_ENABLED controls the visibility.
# To enable
