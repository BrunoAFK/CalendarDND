Calendar DND is an Android app that automatically manages Do Not Disturb based on your calendar.
It turns DND on when meetings start and off when they end, with smart handling for overlapping
and back-to-back events.

Current features:
- Automatic DND during calendar meetings.
- Calendar selection and event filters (busy-only, ignore all-day, minimum duration).
- DND mode options (Priority Only or Total Silence).
- Start offset support (early or delayed DND).
- Optional pre-DND reminder notification.
- Smart meeting window merging (no flicker between back-to-back events).
- Respects manual DND changes during meetings.
- Quick Settings tile for one-tap automation toggle.
- Multi-language UI (English, German, Croatian, Italian, Korean, Chinese).
- On-device privacy with optional analytics/crash reporting opt-in.
