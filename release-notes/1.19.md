#New Features
- Vibration cool-down after DND ends (choose a duration or “until post‑meeting notification”).
- Status screen now shows overlapping active/upcoming events with quick actions.

#Improvements
- DND stays on through the final minute of a meeting to avoid early cut‑off.
- Skipping a single event is more reliable and won’t affect the next event preview.
- Meeting overrun notification is simpler and more consistent.
- Minor UI polish and translation updates.
