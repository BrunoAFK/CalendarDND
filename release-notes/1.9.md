# What’s new
- Advanced notification settings with sliders for pre-DND and post-meeting timing, plus a silent post-meeting toggle.
- Post-meeting notifications now support delayed triggers reliably.
- Pre-DND reminders now show the DND active window (start–end time).
- Keyword filter adds regex mode with richer examples and cleaner layout.
- Release notes now render markdown (titles, lists, bold/italic, links).

# Improvements
- Debug logs split capture level vs view filter; warning is the default capture level.
- Debug log actions moved into an overflow menu for a cleaner header.
- Debug language picker works in release builds.
- Debug build icons use distinct background colors (Play light green, Manual yellow, F-Droid purple).
