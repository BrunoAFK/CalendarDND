# New
- A refreshed main screen design with added functionality that’s cleaner and easier to read (you can always go back to the legacy design in Settings
  → Colors & Themes).
- Choose which days automation should run (e.g., weekdays only).
- Skip recurring events with a single filter option.
- Quick actions on the next event card: enable DND just for that event or skip it.

# Improvements
- Polished UI and translations.
- Improved logic and onboarding flow.
- Improved Debug Tools and tighter Google Play integration.
