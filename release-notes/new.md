# New features
- Broadcast updates via Firebase Cloud Messaging (topic-based), with deep-link actions to key screens.
- Firebase Performance Monitoring (minimal traces for engine runs and DND toggles).
- Added deep links

# Improvements
- Notification icon re-centered for Pixel devices; overrun notification uses the same icon.
- Pre-DND notifications now use private lockscreen visibility with a generic public version.
- Redacted debug share no longer includes the title keyword pattern.

# Security
- Manual update APK filenames are sanitized to prevent path traversal.
