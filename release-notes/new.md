Improvements:
- New “vibration cool-down” option after DND ends (keeps the phone on vibrate for a chosen time or until the post‑meeting notification).
- Status screen now shows overlapping active/upcoming events, with quick actions right from the event list.
- DND timing is a bit smarter: it stays active through the final minute of a meeting to avoid cutting off early.
- Skipping a single event is more reliable and won’t affect the next event preview.
- Meeting overrun notification has a simplified channel and is more consistent.
- Small UI polish and translation updates.
